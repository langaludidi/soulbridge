# Memorial Creation Fix - October 21, 2025

## What You Reported

> "i tried to create a real memorial using a real profile, it failed to create"

## What I Did

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging ✅

**File:** `app/api/memorials/route.ts`

The memorial creation API now provides detailed error information:
- Shows actual database error messages
- Includes error codes and hints
- Logs full request body for debugging
- Returns error details to the client

**Before:**
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to create memorial"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to create memorial",
  "details": "duplicate key value violates unique constraint",
  "code": "23505"
}
```

### 2. Fixed OG Metadata Bug ✅

**File:** `lib/og-metadata.ts`

Fixed references to non-existent `headline` field:
- Now uses `biography` or `obituary` for descriptions
- Generates 100-character excerpts for meta descriptions
- No more "undefined" in OG images

### 3. Created Missing Database Function ✅

**File:** `supabase/migrations/009_share_tracking_function.sql`

Created the `increment_share_count()` function needed for share tracking.

**Status:** ⚠️ Migration created but NOT applied to database yet!

## What You Need to Do

### STEP 1: Run Database Migration (REQUIRED)

Open your Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_share_count(memorial_id UUID)
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE memorials
  SET share_count = COALESCE(share_count, 0) + 1
  WHERE id = memorial_id;
END;
$$;

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION increment_share_count(UUID) TO service_role;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION increment_share_count(UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION increment_share_count(UUID) TO anon;
```

### STEP 2: Try Creating Memorial Again

1. Go to `/create-memorial` page
2. Fill in all required fields:
   - First Name ✅
   - Last Name ✅
   - Date of Birth ✅
   - Date of Death ✅
3. Click "Create Memorial"

### STEP 3: Check for Errors

If it still fails, check these places:

#### Browser Console (F12)
- Look in Console tab for JavaScript errors
- Look in Network tab for failed API calls
- Check response body of `/api/memorials` request

#### Dev Server Logs
You'll now see detailed logs like:
```
Error creating memorial: <detailed error>
Error details: <full PostgreSQL error>
Request body: <your submitted data>
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Memorial limit reached"
**Cause:** You've reached your plan's memorial limit (Lite plan = 1 memorial)

**Solution:**
1. Check how many memorials you have: Go to Dashboard
2. Delete old memorials OR
3. Upgrade to Essential (3 memorials) or Premium (10 memorials)

### Issue 2: "Profile not found"
**Cause:** Your user profile doesn't exist in Supabase

**Solution:**
1. Sign out of SoulBridge
2. Sign back in
3. Check Supabase → profiles table → your Clerk ID should be there
4. Try creating memorial again

### Issue 3: "Missing required fields"
**Cause:** One of the required fields is empty

**Solution:**
- Ensure first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, date_of_death are all filled
- Check for red borders around empty fields

### Issue 4: Images not uploading
**Cause:** Image too large or wrong format

**Solution:**
- Use JPEG or PNG only
- Keep file size under 5MB
- Compress image if needed

---

## Debugging Steps

1. **Open Browser Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Try creating memorial**
4. **Look for errors**:
   - Red errors in Console
   - Failed requests in Network tab (status 400/403/500)
   - Click on failed request → Response tab → see error details

5. **Check dev server terminal**:
   - Look for "Error creating memorial:" messages
   - Note the error code and details

6. **Send me**:
   - Screenshot of browser console errors
   - Copy of dev server error logs
   - Error details from Network tab

## Next Steps After Memorial Creation Works

1. **Test OG Images**:
   - Visit `/api/og/memorial/[memorial-id]`
   - Should see beautiful generated image

2. **Test Social Sharing**:
   - Add `<SocialSharing />` component to memorial pages
   - Test sharing on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp

3. **Deploy to Production**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod --yes
   ```

4. **Test with Facebook Debugger**:
   - https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
   - Paste your memorial URL
   - See OG preview

## Still Having Issues?

If memorial creation still fails after trying the above:

1. Check your Supabase logs:
   - Supabase Dashboard → Logs → API
   - Look for errors when you try to create

2. Share these details:
   - Browser console screenshot
   - Dev server error logs
   - Supabase API error logs
   - Which step failed (image upload? memorial creation?)

I've made the error messages much more detailed, so you'll see exactly what's wrong!
