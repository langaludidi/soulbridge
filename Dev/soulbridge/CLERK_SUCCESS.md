## 🔐 Authentication Flow - Ready to Test

### Test Sign-Up

1. **Visit:** https://soulbridge.co.za
2. **Click:** "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
3. **Expected:** Clerk sign-up form loads
4. **Create:** Test account with real email
5. **Expected:** Redirects to `/dashboard`
6. **Verify:** Check Supabase `profiles` table - user should appear
7. **Verify:** Check `user_plans` table - Lite plan should be assigned

### Test Sign-In

1. **Sign out** (if signed in)
2. **Visit:** https://soulbridge.co.za/sign-in
3. **Enter:** Credentials
4. **Expected:** Redirects to `/dashboard`
5. **Verify:** Session persists (refresh page, still signed in)

### Test Protected Routes

1. **Sign out**
2. **Try:** https://soulbridge.co.za/dashboard
3. **Expected:** Redirects to `/sign-in`
4. **Sign in**
5. **Expected:** Returns to `/dashboard`

### Test Webhook

After sign-up, check:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT
  p.email,
  p.clerk_user_id,
  up.plan_type,
  up.plan_status,
  up.max_memorials
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN user_plans up ON p.id = up.profile_id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected:**
- New user appears in `profiles`
- Lite plan assigned in `user_plans`
- `plan_status` = 'active'
- `max_memorials` = 1

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Middleware Invocation Failed

**Fix:** Added `soulbridge.co.za` to Clerk Dashboard → Paths → Home URL
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Invalid Path Pattern
**Error:** `Invalid path: /memorials/[^/]+/edit(.*)`
**Cause:** Regex pattern not compatible with Clerk's path-to-regexp
**Fix:** Changed to `/memorials/:id/edit(.*)`
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 3: Webhook Secret Mismatch
**Error:** N/A (preventive)
