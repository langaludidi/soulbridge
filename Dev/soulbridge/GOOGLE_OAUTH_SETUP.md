# Google OAuth Configuration - SoulBridge

**Client ID:** `[YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID].apps.googleusercontent.com`
**Status:** Configuration Required

---

## Overview

Setting up Google OAuth ("Sign in with Google") allows users to authenticate using their Google accounts instead of creating a password.

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Faster sign-up (1-click)
- âœ… No password to remember
- âœ… Better security (Google handles auth)
- âœ… Improved user experience

---

## Part 1: Configure in Clerk Dashboard

### Step 1: Enable Google OAuth

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard:** https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. **Navigate to:** User & authentication â†’ **SSO connections**
3. **Find:** Google (should be in the list)
4. **Click:** Toggle to enable Google OAuth

---

### Step 2: Get Clerk's Redirect URI

After enabling Google in Clerk, you'll see:

**Authorized redirect URI:**
```
https://clerk.soulbridge.co.za/v1/oauth_callback
```

**Copy this URI** - you'll need it for Google Cloud Console.

---

### Step 3: Enter Google Credentials in Clerk

In the Google OAuth settings in Clerk, you'll see fields for:

**Client ID:**
```
[YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID].apps.googleusercontent.com
```

**Client Secret:**
```
[You need to get this from Google Cloud Console]
```

**Don't save yet** - we need to configure Google Cloud Console first.

---

## Part 2: Configure Google Cloud Console

### Step 1: Access Google Cloud Console

1. **Visit:** https://console.cloud.google.com
2. **Sign in** with the Google account that owns this OAuth client
3. **Select your project** (or create one if needed)

---

### Step 2: Go to OAuth Consent Screen

1. **Navigate to:** APIs & Services â†’ **OAuth consent screen**
2. **Verify these settings:**

#### Application Information
```
App name: SoulBridge Memorials
User support email: [your-email@soulbridge.co.za]
Application homepage: https://soulbridge.co.za
```

#### Application Domain
```
Application home page: https://soulbridge.co.za
Application privacy policy: https://soulbridge.co.za/privacy
Application terms of service: https://soulbridge.co.za/terms
```

#### Authorized Domains
Add these domains:
```
soulbridge.co.za
clerk.soulbridge.co.za
```

#### Developer Contact Information
```
Email addresses: [your-email@soulbridge.co.za]
```

3. **Save and Continue**

---

### Step 3: Configure OAuth Client

1. **Navigate to:** APIs & Services â†’ **Credentials**
2. **Find your OAuth 2.0 Client:**
   - Client ID: `[YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID].apps.googleusercontent.com`
3. **Click on it to edit**

---

### Step 4: Add Authorized Redirect URIs

**CRITICAL:** Add these exact URIs to "Authorized redirect URIs":

```
https://clerk.soulbridge.co.za/v1/oauth_callback
https://accounts.soulbridge.co.za/v1/oauth_callback
```

**Also add these for development (optional):**
```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
https://soulbridge.co.za/api/auth/callback/google
```

**Screenshot the Client Secret** or copy it - you'll need it for Clerk.

4. **Click "Save"**

---

### Step 5: Get Client Secret

If you don't have the client secret:

1. In the OAuth client edit screen
2. Look for **"Client secret"** field
3. If you can't see it, click **"Download JSON"**
4. Open the JSON file and find the `client_secret` field
5. **Copy the client secret**

Example format: `GOCSPX-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

---

### Test 2: Production Environment

---

### Verify in Supabase

```sql
SELECT
  p.email,
  p.clerk_user_id,
  p.first_name,
  p.last_name,
  up.plan_type
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN user_plans up ON p.id = up.profile_id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Redirect URI mismatch"

**Error message:**
```
Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch
```

**Solution:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console â†’ Credentials
2. Verify exact URI is added:
   ```
   https://clerk.soulbridge.co.za/v1/oauth_callback
   ```
3. Check for trailing slashes (shouldn't have one)
4. Wait 5 minutes after saving in Google Console
5. Try again

---

### Issue: "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"

**Cause:** OAuth consent screen not configured properly

**Solution:**
1. Go to OAuth consent screen
2. Fill in ALL required fields:
   - App name
   - Support email
   - Developer contact
   - Authorized domains
3. Save and try again

---

### Issue: "Google" button not showing in Clerk

**Check:**
1. Clerk Dashboard â†’ SSO connections â†’ Google is **enabled**
2. Client ID and Secret are **entered and saved**
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try incognito mode

---

### Issue: User created but no profile in Supabase

**Debug:**
1. Check Clerk Dashboard â†’ Webhooks
2. View recent webhook attempts
3. Should see `user.created` event
4. Check Vercel logs:
   ```bash
   vercel logs soulbridge | grep webhook
   ```
5. Verify webhook secret matches
