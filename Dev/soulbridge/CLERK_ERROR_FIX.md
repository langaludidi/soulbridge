## Detailed Steps with Screenshots

### 1. Clerk Dashboard - Domains

**Location:** Dashboard ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí Domains

### 2. Clerk Dashboard - Paths

**Location:** Dashboard ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí Paths

**Verify these paths:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|

| Sign-up path | `/sign-up` |
| After sign-in | `/dashboard` |

## Alternative: Temporary Fix for Testing

If you want to test immediately while waiting for domain authorization:

### Option 1: Use Vercel Preview URL

The Vercel preview URL should work:
```
https://soulbridge-q5n3q3825-ludidil-5352s-projects.vercel.app
```

Add this to Clerk authorized domains temporarily.

### Option 2: Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

Local development should work fine.

---

## Why This Happened

1. **We updated to production Clerk keys** ‚úÖ
2. **We deployed the changes** ‚úÖ
3. **But**: Production domain not yet authorized in Clerk Dashboard ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is a normal part of the setup process!

## After You Fix This

Once the domain is authorized:

### Test Checklist:

- [ ] Visit https://soulbridge.co.za (should load)
- [ ] Click "Sign Up" (should show Clerk signup form)
- [ ] Create test account
- [ ] Verify redirects to /dashboard
- [ ] Check Supabase profiles table (user should appear)
- [ ] Check user_plans table (Lite plan should be assigned)
- [ ] Sign out
- [ ] Sign in again (should work)
- [ ] Try to access /dashboard without being signed in (should redirect to /sign-in)

## Still Having Issues?

### Check these:

**1. Environment Variables in Vercel:**

vercel env ls
```

**2. Clerk Instance Type:**
Go to Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Check you're in **Production** instance (not Development)

Verify keys start with:
