## ‚úÖ 2. DATABASE MIGRATIONS

### Required Migrations (in order):

1. **001_initial_schema.sql** - Profiles, sessions, audit logs
2. **002_memorials_schema.sql** - Memorials, tributes, candles, media
3. **003_timeline_and_sharing.sql** - Timeline events, shares

8. **008_plan_usage_triggers.sql** - Memorial count triggers
9. **009_share_tracking_function.sql** - Share count function ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW

### How to Verify Migrations:

Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Check what tables exist
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Expected tables:**
- [ ] `profiles`
- [ ] `user_sessions`
- [ ] `audit_logs`
- [ ] `memorials`
- [ ] `memorial_media`
- [ ] `tributes`
- [ ] `virtual_candles`
- [ ] `timeline_events`
- [ ] `memorial_shares`
- [ ] `user_plans`
- [ ] `payment_transactions`
- [ ] `plan_usage`
- [ ] `order_of_service` (optional)

---

## ‚úÖ 3. DATABASE FUNCTIONS

### Required Functions:

Run this to check:
```sql
SELECT
    routine_name,
    routine_type
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY routine_name;
```

**Expected functions:**
- [ ] `can_create_memorial(UUID)` - Checks if user can create memorial
- [ ] `get_active_user_plan(UUID)` - Gets user's active plan
- [ ] `increment_share_count(UUID)` - Increments share count ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW
- [ ] `generate_memorial_slug(TEXT, TEXT, DATE)` - Generates URL slug
- [ ] `create_default_user_plan()` - Creates Lite plan for new users
- [ ] `activate_plan_after_payment()` - Activates plan after payment
- [ ] `update_memorial_counters()` - Updates tribute/candle counts
- [ ] `update_memorial_count_on_create()` - Increments memorial count
- [ ] `update_memorial_count_on_delete()` - Decrements memorial count

### Missing Function? Run Migration 009

If `increment_share_count` is missing:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_share_count(memorial_id UUID)
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE memorials
  SET share_count = COALESCE(share_count, 0) + 1
  WHERE id = memorial_id;
END;
$$;

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION increment_share_count(UUID) TO service_role;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION increment_share_count(UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION increment_share_count(UUID) TO anon;
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. STORAGE BUCKET

### Check Storage Setup:

1. **Go to:** Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. **Look for bucket:** `memorial-media`
3. **Settings should be:**
   - ‚úÖ Public bucket: **ON**
   - ‚úÖ File size limit: **100 MB** (or at least 10MB)
   - ‚úÖ Allowed MIME types: `image/*`, `video/*`, `audio/*`

### Check Storage Policies:

```sql
SELECT
    policyname,
    cmd,
    qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'storage'
  AND tablename = 'objects'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

**Expected policies:**
- [ ] `Public Access` (SELECT)
- [ ] `Authenticated users can upload` (INSERT)
- [ ] `Service role can upload` (INSERT) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
- [ ] `Users can update own files` (UPDATE)
- [ ] `Users can delete own files` (DELETE)

### Missing Policies? Run This:

Use the SQL from `STORAGE_BUCKET_SETUP.sql`:

```sql
-- Drop and recreate all policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public Access" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can upload" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own files" ON storage.objects;

-- Create fresh policies
CREATE POLICY "Public Access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'memorial-media');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'memorial-media' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Service role can upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'memorial-media' AND auth.role() = 'service_role');

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own files"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (bucket_id = 'memorial-media' AND (auth.role() = 'authenticated' OR auth.role() = 'service_role'));

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own files"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (bucket_id = 'memorial-media' AND (auth.role() = 'authenticated' OR auth.role() = 'service_role'));
```

---

## ‚úÖ 5. ROW LEVEL SECURITY (RLS)

### Check RLS is Enabled:

```sql
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**All tables should have `rowsecurity = true`**

### Check Table Policies:

```sql
-- Check memorials policies
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'memorials';

-- Check profiles policies
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'profiles';

-- Check user_plans policies
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'user_plans';
```

**Expected for memorials:**
- Anyone can view published public memorials (SELECT)
- Users can view their own memorials (SELECT)
- Users can create their own memorials (INSERT)
- Users can update their own memorials (UPDATE)
- Users can delete their own memorials (DELETE)
- Service role can do everything (ALL)

---

## ‚úÖ 6. AUTHENTICATION INTEGRATION

### Clerk ‚Üí Supabase Sync:

Check webhook is configured:
1. **Clerk Dashboard** ‚Üí Webhooks
2. **Endpoint:** `https://soulbridge.co.za/api/webhooks/clerk`
3. **Events subscribed:**
   - `user.created`
   - `user.updated`
   - `session.created`

### Verify Profile Creation:

```sql
-- Check if your profile exists
SELECT * FROM profiles
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Check if profiles are being created
SELECT
    clerk_user_id,
    email,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    created_at
FROM profiles
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## ‚úÖ 7. PLAN SYSTEM

### Check Default Plan Creation:

```sql
-- Check if new users get Lite plan
SELECT
    p.email,
    up.plan_type,
    up.max_memorials,
    up.plan_status,
    up.valid_until
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN user_plans up ON p.id = up.profile_id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Every profile should have a user_plan**

### Missing Plans? Check Trigger:

```sql
SELECT
    trigger_name,
    event_manipulation,
    action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public'
  AND event_object_table = 'profiles';
```

**Expected:** `create_default_plan_trigger` on INSERT

---

## ‚úÖ 8. API ENDPOINTS

### Test These Endpoints Work:

```bash
# Test profile endpoint
curl https://soulbridge.co.za/api/profile

# Test memorials endpoint
curl https://soulbridge.co.za/api/memorials

# Test upload endpoint (requires auth)
# curl -X POST -F "file=@test.jpg" https://soulbridge.co.za/api/upload
```

---

## ‚úÖ 9. DEPLOYMENT CHECKS

### Vercel Environment Variables:

```bash
vercel env ls
```

**Should show:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (Production, Preview, Development)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (Production, Preview, Development)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (Production, Preview, Development)
- Plus all Clerk variables

### Build Configuration:

Check `vercel.json` or project settings:
- Node version: 18.x or higher
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `.next`

---

## ‚úÖ 10. COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue: "Profile not found"
**Fix:** User profile not synced from Clerk
```sql
-- Manually create profile
INSERT INTO profiles (clerk_user_id, email, first_name, last_name)
VALUES ('user_xxx', 'email@example.com', 'First', 'Last');
```

### Issue: "Memorial limit reached" (Lite plan has 0/1)
**Fix:** Plan usage not tracking correctly
```sql
-- Reset memorial count
UPDATE plan_usage pu
SET current_memorials_count = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM memorials m
    WHERE m.profile_id = pu.profile_id
)
WHERE pu.plan_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM user_plans WHERE plan_type = 'lite'
);
```

### Issue: "Failed to upload file"
**Fix:** Storage bucket or policies missing (see section 4)

### Issue: Share tracking not working
**Fix:** Missing `increment_share_count` function (see section 3)

## üìã QUICK VERIFICATION SCRIPT

Run this one SQL query to check everything:

```sql
-- Comprehensive health check
SELECT
    'Tables' as category,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Functions' as category,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Storage Policies' as category,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'storage'

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Profiles' as category,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM profiles

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'User Plans' as category,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM user_plans

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Memorials' as category,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM memorials;
```

**Expected Results:**
- Tables: ~12-15
- Functions: ~9
- Storage Policies: ~5
- Profiles: (your user count)
- User Plans: (should match profiles)
- Memorials: (your memorial count)
